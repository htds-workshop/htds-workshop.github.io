# The Workshop on Heterogeneous Trust in Distributed Systems

Many permissionless systems are based on a global, collective assumption about
adversarial behavior -- e.g. that less than 50% of hashing power or staked
tokens are adversarial, as in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

However, other systems, like the XRP ledger, MobileCoin, the Stellar network,
and the Anoma protocol, allow each participant to flexibly make its own
assumptions about failures and adversaries. This flexibility is useful, for
example:

- As a more egalitarian approach than proof-of-work and proof-of-stake for
  building permissionless systems, e.g. using asymmetric, trust-based quorum
  systems.
- Allowing each validator to choose its own tradeoff between performance and
  security by adjusting its quorums.
- For Oracle networks, where users may have different degrees of trust in
  different signers.
- As a more inclusive system that allows participants to coexist
  constructively, with different (or even incompatible) beliefs and
  assumptions.

The design space for heterogeneous-trust systems has attracted the attention of
several research groups, leading to disparate models and algorithms.

We would like to encourage this work to consolidate and thus move forward this
mathematically interesting and practically important field.  The workshop will
bring together researchers interested in distributed systems based on
heterogeneous trust, and help coalesce a new and active community on topic.

# Location and dates

The workshop co-located with [AFT 2023](https://aftconf.github.io/aft23/index.html)
and will take place on October 26th, 2023 in Princeton, New Jersey, at the [Friend Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Friend+Center+for+Engineering+Education,+7799+William+St,+Princeton,+NJ+08540/@40.3503606,-74.6534157,19.09z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c3e6c2c6e8d9f9:0x997e4572848080d8!8m2!3d40.3503041!4d-74.6526987!16s%2Fg%2F12hrg1gp3?entry=ttu) Convocation Room (Room 113; same room as AFT).

# Call for abstracts

We solicit submissions of talk abstracts and full papers on topics related to heterogeneous
trust in distributed systems, including but not limited to:
- Mathematical models of heterogeneous trust
- Distributed algorithms under heterogeneous-trust models, including consensus
  algorithms
