# The Workshop on Heterogeneous Trust in Distributed Systems

Many permissionless systems are based on a global, collective assumption about
adversarial behavior -- e.g. that less than 50% of hashing power or staked
tokens are adversarial, as in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

However, other systems, like the XRP ledger, MobileCoin, the Stellar network,
and the Anoma protocol, allow each participant to flexibly make its own
assumptions about failures and adversaries. This flexibility is useful, for
example:

- As a more egalitarian approach than proof-of-work and proof-of-stake for
  building permissionless systems, e.g. using asymmetric, trust-based quorum
  systems.
- Allowing each validator to choose its own tradeoff between performance and
  security by adjusting its quorums.
- For Oracle networks, where users may have different degrees of trust in
  different signers.
- As a more inclusive system that allows participants to coexist
  constructively, with different (or even incompatible) beliefs and
  assumptions.

The design space for heterogeneous-trust systems has attracted the attention of
several research groups, leading to disparate models and algorithms.

We would like to encourage this work to consolidate and thus move forward this
mathematically interesting and practically important field.  The workshop will
bring together researchers interested in distributed systems based on
heterogeneous trust, and help coalesce a new and active community on topic.

## Format

We solicit submissions of talk abstracts on topics related to heterogeneous
trust in distributed systems, including but not limited to:
- Mathematical models of heterogeneous trust
- Distributed algorithms under heterogeneous-trust models, including consensus
  algorithms
- Descriptions of system designs or implementations based on heterogeneous
  trust
- Sybil resilience based on heterogeneous trust
- Peer-to-peer networking based on heterogeneous trust
- Cryptography and multi-party computation under heterogeneous trust
  assumptions
- Heterogeneous trust in reconfigurable and dynamic systems
- Social dynamics in heterogeneous trust systems

Titles and abstracts will be published on the workshop website. There will not
be any workshop proceedings.  Authors of selected submissions will be invited
to submit a paper to a journal special issue.
